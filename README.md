# EmoSentry: Emoji-Powered Hate Speech Detection with Bi-LSTM and GloVe Embeddings

## Overview
EmoSentry is an advanced hate speech detection system that leverages the power of Bi-LSTM neural networks and GloVe embeddings to accurately identify and classify hate speech in social media content. The unique aspect of EmoSentry is its ability to interpret both textual content and emojis, making it a robust tool for detecting abusive language in the nuanced, emoji-rich communications found on platforms like Twitter.

## Key Features
- **Bi-LSTM Neural Network:** Utilizes a bidirectional LSTM network to effectively capture the context and semantics of both text and emojis in social media posts.
- **GloVe Embeddings:** Implements GloVe embeddings to convert textual data into meaningful vector representations, enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to understand and classify hate speech.
- **Extensive Dataset:** Trained on a dataset of 42,000 tweets, ensuring the model is well-equipped to handle diverse and complex inputs.
- **Emoji-Based Classification:** Specifically designed to recognize and classify hate speech conveyed through emojis, addressing a significant gap in traditional hate speech detection methods.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Integrated with a feedback mechanism and capable of analyzing live stream comments, making it suitable for real-time hate speech monitoring on platforms like YouTube.
- **Automated Identification:** Features an automated system for flagging and reporting hate speech, enabling proactive moderation of online content.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- GloVe Embeddings
- Twitter API (for data collection)
- YouTube API (for live stream analysis)

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmoSentry.git
```
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. **Train the Model:** Use the provided scripts to train the Bi-LSTM model on your dataset.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring:** Set up the YouTube API integration for live stream comment analysis.
3. **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement the feedback loop to improve model accuracy over time.

### Results
EmoSentry has demonstrated a high accuracy rate in detecting hate speech, particularly in the context of emoji usage, outperforming traditional models by a significant margin.
